# Python Debugging ‚Äì Identifying and Fixing Errors

This project focuses on **debugging Python and web code**, identifying errors, and applying fixes.  
It contains scripts and programs with intentional bugs, which were corrected to ensure proper functionality.

## üìå Learning Objectives
- Identify syntax and logic errors in Python and web code.  
- Debug programs to prevent infinite loops, crashes, or incorrect output.  
- Implement error handling in Python programs.  
- Test code to ensure it behaves as expected.  
- Understand basic Python programming concepts through debugging exercises.

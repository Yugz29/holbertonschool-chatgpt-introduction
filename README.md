# holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction ‚Äì Python Debugging: Identifying and Fixing Errors

This repository contains exercises focused on **debugging Python scripts and web code**, **error handling**, and practicing Python fundamentals.  
The projects involve identifying bugs, correcting logic and syntax errors, and ensuring programs run as expected.

## üìå Learning Objectives
- Detect and correct syntax and logic errors in Python and JavaScript code.  
- Apply debugging techniques to solve runtime errors and unexpected behavior.  
- Implement proper error handling to prevent program crashes.  
- Practice Python programming concepts: loops, conditionals, functions, recursion.  
- Handle command-line arguments and user input safely.  
- Debug and test interactive terminal games and HTML/JS applications.
